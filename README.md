## Description/Motivation

Create a blockchain-based voting system that ensures the security and privacy of votes. Emphasize aspects like data integrity and immutability. With increasing concerns about election integrity and vote manipulation, blockchain can offer a trustworthy solution. I'm interested in applying my technical knowledge of blockchain to solve real-world problems like securing voting systems and ensuring data integrity.

### Prerequisites

## Installation and Setup for Windows
- Windows 10 or higher (version 2004 or higher). Build 19041.xxx or higher.
- 64-bit machine (System type x64 based PC)


# `dvote`

Welcome to my `dvote` project and to the Internet Computer development community. 
To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.
To learn more before you start working with `dvote`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start running this project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dvote/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.


To see the frontend/ user interface, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```
